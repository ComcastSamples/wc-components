# Introduction to Web Components via Shared Components

### Hello! :wave:

Thanks for coming to our hands-on introduction to Web Components & Polymer! If you stumbled onto this and weren't at the event, hopefully this is still of somewhat use :-)

This is all the materials that are required to get started:

[Install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)  
[Install Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Use [nvm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you'd like multiple versions)  

Run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/ComcastSamples/wc-components.git  
git clone https://github.com/ComcastSamples/reacthnpwa  
cd wc-components/ && npm install  
cd ../reacthnpwa && npm install  
```
Optionally install [lit-html extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) for vscode to make it easier to edit markup in template literals.

In a separate terminal window run `cd reacthnpwa && npm start` - to start up the react hacker news application. We'll be working on
getting our web components to run in that application. For large companies with multiple sites, having a shared global header
and footer creates unity between multiple sites. We do this @ Comcast with https://github.com/Comcast/polaris
