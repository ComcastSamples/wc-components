# Step 1

`npm start` this project, your browser should open to http://localhost:3001

Make sure you have the [React HN app](https://github.com/ComcastSamples/reacthnpwa) also up and running on http://localhost:3000

1. Get the wc-footer added to the React app
2. Optimize for production
  * Open package.json add build script `NODE_ENV=production rollup -c rollup.config.js`
  * Add uglify and only have it run if NODE_ENV is production

When you're done, `git checkout -f step2`
