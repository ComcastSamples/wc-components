# Introduction to Web Components via a Shared Header

### Hello! :wave:

Thanks for coming to our hands-on introduction to Web Components & Polymer! If you stumbled onto this and weren't at the event, hopefully this is still of somewhat use :-)

This is all the materials that are required to get started:

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
2. [Install Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (If you'd like to manage multiple version of Node, we recommend [nvm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
3. Install the Polymer CLI globally: `$ npm install -g polymer-cli@latest`
4. Clone this repo (`$ git clone https://github.com/ComcastSamples/wc-header.git`)
5. Install the dependencies by `$ npm install` from the directory you cloned `wc-header` into
6. `$ git checkout step1` to get started.

Optionally install [lit-html extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) for vscode to make it easier to edit markup in template literals.

Please reach out to us on Twitter, we're happy to help :-)
